<h3>What to do:</h3><br>

<p>If you're using a <strong>shared hosting</strong>, sometimes you can select which version of PHP and MySQL to use. Check your account Control Panel to see if you can change the MySQL version to 5.6 or higher. If not, maybe you need to open a ticket with them (or migrate to a hosting company that likes updated software).</p>
<br>
<p>If you're on a <strong>VPS</strong>, <strong>dedicated server</strong> or a <strong>local server</strong> (localhost):<br>
	- If you're using a package manager (like <code>apt-get</code> or <code>homebrew</code>): upgrade your repository base (e.g. <code>apt-get upgrade</code>) and update the MySQL package using its corresponding command.<br>
	- If you're running bundled software stacks like <a href="https://www.mamp.info/en/" target="_blank">MAMP</a>, <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/" target="_blank">WampServer</a> or
	<a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/pt_br/index.html" target="_blank">XAMPP</a>, or used the graphical <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/" target="_blank">MySQL installer</a>, maybe just upgrading your stack is enough. Download the new version from the vendor website;<br>
	- If your MySQL was compiled from source: read the MySQL documentation to see how to upgrade.
